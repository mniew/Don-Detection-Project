# Don-Detection-Project

This project aims to tackle the problem of Vomitoxin (DON) infected corn. DON is a toxin that when ingested by livestock, leads to digestive problems. Conventional analysis of DON in corn is done by taking a sample of the entire stock and using a destructive process to determine the DON content of the corn. 
The DON content has implications on the selling price for the harvest of corn. Our project will be used to increase the value of the harvested corn by removing infected corn kernels. This will provide a great benefit to farmers. 

By the end of this project me delivered, a DON-infected corn removal machine and analyzer. This machine has been broken down into four main stages: a kernel linearizer, a kernel detector, a kernel ejector and a control system designed to link the components of the project together. The input to our machine will be corn kernels that may or may not contain DON. The output of the machine will be broken into two streams, “Cleaned” corn kernels and DON infected kernels.  

Contained within this repository you will find the main code used for identifying the position of each of the kernels within the frame. This information was forwarded to a microcontroller that controlled actuated trap doors.
